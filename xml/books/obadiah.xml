    <verse order="1">The vision of Obadiah.
Thus says the Lord God <refs>Is. 21:11; Ezek. 25:12; Joel 3:19; Mal. 1:3</refs>concerning Edom
<refs>Jer. 49:14–16; Obad. 1–4</refs>(We have heard a report from the Lord,
And a messenger has been sent among the nations, saying,
“Arise, and let us rise up against her for battle”):</verse>
    <verse order="2">“Behold, I will make you small among the nations;
You shall be greatly despised.</verse>
    <verse order="3">The <refs>Is. 16:6; Jer. 49:16</refs>pride of your heart has deceived you,
You who dwell in the clefts of the rock,
Whose habitation is high;
<refs>Is. 14:13–15; Rev. 18:7</refs>You who say in your heart, ‘Who will bring me down to the ground?’</verse>
    <verse order="4">Though you ascend as high as the eagle,
And though you <refs>Hab. 2:9; Mal. 1:4</refs>set your nest among the stars,
From there I will bring you down,” says the Lord.</verse>
    <verse order="5">“If <refs>Jer. 49:9</refs>thieves had come to you,
If robbers by night—
Oh, how you will be cut off!—
Would they not have stolen till they had enough?
If grape-gatherers had come to you,
<refs>Deut. 24:21</refs>Would they not have left some gleanings?</verse>
    <verse order="6">“Oh, how Esau shall be searched out!
How his hidden treasures shall be sought after!</verse>
    <verse order="7">All the men in your confederacy
Shall force you to the border;
<refs>Jer. 38:22</refs>The men at peace with you
Shall deceive you and prevail against you.
Those who eat your bread shall lay a trap for you.
<refs>Is. 19:11; Jer. 49:7</refs>No one is aware of it.</verse>
    <verse order="8">“Will<refs>(Job 5:12–14); Is. 29:14</refs> I not in that day,” says the Lord,
“Even destroy the wise men from Edom,
And understanding from the mountains of Esau?</verse>
    <verse order="9">Then your <refs>Ps. 76:5</refs>mighty men, O <refs>Gen. 36:11; 1 Chr. 1:45; Job 2:11; Jer. 49:7</refs>Teman, shall be dismayed,
To the end that everyone from the mountains of Esau
May be cut off by slaughter.</verse>
    <section title="Edom Mistreated His Brother"/>
    <verse order="10">“For <refs>Gen. 27:41; Ezek. 25:12; Amos 1:11</refs>violence against your brother Jacob,
Shame shall cover you,
And <refs>Ezek. 35:9; Joel 3:19</refs>you shall be cut off forever.</verse>
    <verse order="11">In the day that you <refs>Ps. 83:5–8; Amos 1:6, 9</refs>stood on the other side—
In the day that strangers carried captive his forces,
When foreigners entered his gates
And <refs>Joel 3:3; Nah. 3:10</refs>cast lots for Jerusalem—
Even you were as one of them.</verse>
    <verse order="12">“But you should not have <refs>Mic. 4:11; 7:10</refs>gazed on the day of your brother
In the day of his captivity;
Nor should you have <refs>(Prov. 17:5); Ezek. 35:15; 36:5</refs>rejoiced over the children of Judah
In the day of their destruction;
Nor should you have spoken proudly
In the day of distress.</verse>
    <verse order="13">You should not have entered the gate of My people
In the day of their calamity.
Indeed, you should not have gazed on their affliction
In the day of their calamity,
Nor laid hands on their substance
In the day of their calamity.</verse>
    <verse order="14">You should not have stood at the crossroads
To cut off those among them who escaped;
Nor should you have delivered up those among them who remained
In the day of distress.</verse>
    <verse order="15">“For<refs>Ezek. 30:3; (Joel 1:15; 2:1, 11, 31; Amos 5:18, 20)</refs> the day of the Lord upon all the nations is near;
<refs>Jer. 50:29; 51:56; Hab. 2:8</refs>As you have done, it shall be done to you;
Your reprisal shall return upon your own head.</verse>
    <verse order="16">For as you drank on My holy mountain,
So shall all the nations drink continually;
Yes, they shall drink, and swallow,
And they shall be as though they had never been.</verse>
    <section title="Israel’s Final Triumph"/>
    <verse order="17">“But on Mount Zion there <refs>Is. 14:1, 2; Joel 2:32; Amos 9:8</refs>shall be deliverance,
And there shall be holiness;
The house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.</verse>
    <verse order="18">The house of Jacob shall be a fire,
And the house of Joseph <refs>Is. 5:24; 9:18, 19; Zech. 12:6</refs>a flame;
But the house of Esau shall be stubble;
They shall kindle them and devour them,
And no survivor shall remain of the house of Esau,”
For the Lord has spoken.</verse>
    <verse order="19">The South <refs>Is. 11:14; Amos 9:12</refs>shall possess the mountains of Esau,
<refs>Zeph. 2:7</refs>And the Lowland shall possess Philistia.
They shall possess the fields of Ephraim
And the fields of Samaria.
Benjamin shall possess Gilead.</verse>
    <verse order="20">And the captives of this host of the children of Israel
Shall possess the land of the Canaanites
As <refs>1 Kin. 17:9; Luke 4:26</refs>far as Zarephath.
The captives of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad
<refs>Jer. 32:44</refs>Shall possess the cities of the South.</verse>
    <verse order="21">Then <refs>(James 5:20)</refs>saviors shall come to Mount Zion
To judge the mountains of Esau,
And the <refs>Ps. 22:28; (Dan. 2:44; 7:14; Zech. 14:9; Rev. 11:15)</refs>kingdom shall be the Lord’s.</verse>
